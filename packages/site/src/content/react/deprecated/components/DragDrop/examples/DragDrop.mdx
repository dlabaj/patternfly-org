You can use the `<DragDrop>` component to move items in or between lists. The `<DragDrop>` component should contain `<Droppable>` components which contain `<Draggable>` components.

```ts noLive
import { DragDrop, Draggable, Droppable } from '@patternfly/react-core/deprecated';

const DragDropCodeSample: React.FunctionComponent = () => (
  <DragDrop>
    {' '}
    {/* DragDrop houses the context for dragging and dropping */}
    <Droppable>
      <Draggable>You can put anything here! It will be wrapped in a styled div.</Draggable>
      <Draggable>You can have as many Draggables as you like.</Draggable>
    </Droppable>
    <Droppable>
      {' '}
      {/* You can also have many droppables! */}
      <Draggable />
    </Droppable>
  </DragDrop>
);
```

Note: Keyboard accessibility and screen reader accessibility are still in development.
